In this repository you can find exemplary code I wrote for previous projects. 


Visualization of scWGBS data

The files of this project provide graphical representation of basic quality control including coverage statistics, 
methylation distribution, per chromsome depth of coverage information.

* data_overview.Rmd: 
  In this file the information content of two RDS files focusing on the methylation status of CpG sites is used to create data frames.
  These data frames then serve as input for ggplot2. 
  
* data_summary.Rmd:
  In this file more detailed information on CpG content and sequencing depth is extracted for each sample and again used for graphical representation via ggplot2
    


Basic statistics of qPCR data 

* ttest.Rmd
